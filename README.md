Year I, semester II: Data structures and algorithms

course seventeen: Dynamic Programming - The backpack problem

Definition  Dynamic Programming : Dynamic Programming is mainly an optimization over plain recursion. Wherever we see a recursive solution that has repeated calls for same inputs, we can optimize it using Dynamic Programming. The idea is to simply store the results of subproblems, so that we do not have to re-compute them when needed later. This simple optimization reduces time complexities from exponential to polynomial.

The backpack problem: filling the backpack so as to maximize the total profit.
